/*
 * 	Quicksort has a reputation as the fastest sort. One often contrasts quicksort with merge sort,
 *  because both sorts have an average time of O(nlog n).
 *  
 *  "On average, mergesort does fewer comparisons than quicksort, so it may be better when 
 *  complicated comparison routines are used. Mergesort also takes advantage of pre-existing order,
 *  so it would be favored for using sort() to merge several sorted arrays.
 *  On the other hand, quicksort is often faster for small arrays, and on arrays of a few distinct values,
 *  repeated many times." â€” http://perldoc.perl.org/sort.html
 *  Quicksort is at one end of the spectrum of divide-and-conquer algorithms, with merge sort at the opposite end.
 *  Quicksort is a conquer-then-divide algorithm, which does most of the work during the partitioning and the recursive calls.
 *  The subsequent reassembly of the sorted partitions involves trivial effort.
 *  Merge sort is a divide-then-conquer algorithm. The partioning happens in a trivial way, by splitting 
 *  the input array in half. Most of the work happens during the recursive calls and the merge phase.
